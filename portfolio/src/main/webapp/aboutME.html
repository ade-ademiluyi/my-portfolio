            Adetowo Ademiluyi was born on 20 July, 1999 in Lagos, 
            Nigeria, where he lived <br> all his life until he went to 
            college in the United States. He is the <br>first and only male 
            child in a family of four. His father, a retired civil <br>servant, 
            and his mother, an auxiliary nurse, are both Christians, and 
            are involved heavily in the <br> community and in the church. 
            He and his family lived a rural life with similar <br>backgrounds, 
            and intimate familiar ties with other members of the community.
            In his community, not <br> everyone has the privilege of having an 
            education, and as a result, several of the <br>women get married soon
            after hitting puberty and become stay at home moms who take care <br>
            of the children and house work that has to be done. Not all of 
            the men <br>attend college either, most of them choose to learn 
            a trade as soon as they <br>can and settle down early with a family.
            Some make the choice of taking jobs as <br> factory workers as an 
            alternative to attending college. These varieties of lifestyle are 
            somewhat <br>popular where he comes from, and growing up in that 
            community has probably had the <br> most impact on the person that 
            he is today.

            Adetowo comes from a very small community where everybody is 
            pretty much the same, there's <br> not much diversity in the community
            as majority of the people are blacks and the<br> few whites in the 
            community are usually there for tourism. Not having an education 
            was the <br>norm, and even though he was lucky to receive an education
            comparable to the united states <br> high school diploma, he knew he 
            wanted more from life. Growing up, his mother’s version of <br>Christianity
            included a heavy dose of social responsibility. This pushed him earlier 
            into social work and <br>education, but being a bit rebellious by nature, 
            He took his own path getting there. He <br> was influenced on a Cultural level
            by a history he lived through as a child: getting an <br>education wasn’t 
            seen as a necessity, but as something only rich people could have. He <br>
            knew the world could be a harsh place and believed that he could have a 
            role <br>in making it better through education and he worked hard to achieve that. 
            Consequently, he was<br> able to secure a scholarship to get his bachelor’s degree 
            in the United States and fulfill <br> his dream of getting an education.

            Even though he lived most of his life in Nigeria where blacks are the 
            majority, <br>there was still diversity as there are different people from 
            different cultures and his life <br> experiences opened him up to accepting and 
            appreciating those who are culturally diverse from him. while <br>his ability to 
            form relationships with diverse individuals has made him more appreciative of 
            other <br>races, he understands that this does not mean that he knows what life is 
            like as a<br> minority. He has lived his whole life comfortably as part of the majority 
            group in Nigeria<br>.
