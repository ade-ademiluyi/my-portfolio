          <h1>First time i entered a plane</h1>
          <br>
          <p> Growing up, i had always wondered what it felt like 
            to be in a plane <br> flying from one place to another. Actually, it didn't even  
            matter if the plane<br> was moving or not i just wanted to know what that 
            felt like. But, <br> that never really happened. My parents didn't have that kind
            of money<br> for me to have a feeling like that.  Still, i continued to<br> wonder what it felt like.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> Eventually, after 18 years of my life, i finally 
            entered a plane and knew what <br> it felt like not because my parents finally had the money.
            but because i never<br> stopped wondering and i must say it felt amazing seeing 
            those houses that would usually<br>
            look so big look so tiny that i could pick them <br>up with my fingers. Now you might be wondering
            how i was able to make that <br>happen. My parents couldn't afford that then how you might ask?
            well, I promise you it <br>didn't happen in my dream. it just happened  the first time i entered a plane<br>
            was the first time i was leaving my country to school in the united states<br> on a scholarship.
            It only happened because i never stopped dreaming.
